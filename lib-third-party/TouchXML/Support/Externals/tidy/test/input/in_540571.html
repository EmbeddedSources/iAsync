<title>#540571 Inconsistent behaviour with span inline element</title>
</head>
<body>
<font color="red"><h1>Hello World</h1></font>
<p>
The font inline is moved so it becomes a child of the h1 element.
</p>
<span color="red"><h1>Hello World</h1></span>
<p>
The span inline is not moved so it becomes a child of the h1 element, which is inconsistent and does not correspond with current browser behaviour any more.
