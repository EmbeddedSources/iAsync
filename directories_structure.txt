That's why we suggest using the following repository structure :
 1. app Ð for main project sources
 2. lib Ð shared code, maintained by our team. Libraries, containing the model and network protocol bindings should also be stored here.
 3. lib-third-party Ð for libraries and frameworks used by our applications
binaries deployment.
 4. frameworks Ð pre-build third-party libraries and those maintained by our team.
It should contain no *.xcodeproj entries. Instead only deployed libraries must be placed there. All frameworks and universal libraries, developed by our team must be deployed into this directory.
 5. test Ð for unit tests of all kinds (Sen Testing Kit, Google toolbox, GHUnit).
 6. tools Ð ready-to-use binaries and or source code which are used
 7. scripts Ð scripts for continuous integration in bash/ruby/python/<your favorite scripting language>.
 8. certificates Ð contains Apple provision and developer profiles.
 9. deployment Ð this directory is NOT supposed to be under version control. It contains
build artifacts that will be deployed by the build server or in some other (most efficient for you) way.
